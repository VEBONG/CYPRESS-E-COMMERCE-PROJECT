# E-Commerce Project

Welcome to the E-Commerce Test Project repository! This project aims to test a fully functional e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and complete purchases using cypress Page Object Model framework.
Out of about 58 test cases to be executed on the AUT, the first commit has 23 test cases executed while other test scenario and test cases shall be executed or can be as a contribution to the repository. 

I used xpath and css selector to locate page elements and the project is easy to understand.
